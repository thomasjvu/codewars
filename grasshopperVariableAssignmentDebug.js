 * Variable assignment

Fix the variables assigments so that this code stores the string 'devLab' in the variable name.
*/

// Solution
var a = "dev"
var b = "Lab"

var name = a + b

// Explanation
// The undebugged solution consisted of 2 equal signs, which is not correct for assignment.
// Assignment only uses one equal sign, so that was the fix needed for each variable.
