# **Codewars Repository**

This is a repository filled with my completed Codewars challenges (kata). I make it a priority to keep my skills sharp by pushing at least 1 solution every day.

## **How It's Made**

This repository is made by reentering my solutions to build muscle memory. I also try to go the extra mile and include explanations for my solutions as well as refactoring. Solutions are made in the following languages...

## **Optimizations**

I consistently refactor and optimize my code for both efficiency and readability.

### **Lessons Learned**

The biggest lesson I learn while doing Codewars is that there is always something to learn. Even if I don't know the answer right away, I research the MDN until I can solve it. 

## **Other Works**
If you're interested, take a look at a couple other projects that I have in my portfolio!
